  <description>Santos Haulage SA bases its operations out of this small planetoid. Ojose's home system is rather strange and believed to have an interesting, if violent, story behind it. Current ideas suggest that when the star was young two planets somehow ended up in the place at the same time with rather different velocities, the result is the ring that exists today. The humans living here are used to the greatly decreased gravity of their home and the ease of exploring space bodies.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with heavily set people with calm demeanours. They seem to be largely involved in the haulage business and, given the number of bulk carriers outside in the spaceport, slow and steady seems to be the attitude around here. Getting a drink is not quick but when it comes it's something to tide you over for the wait for the next one.</bar>
